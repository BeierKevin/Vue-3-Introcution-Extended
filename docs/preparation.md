# Important

- slides
- Tutoiral (this equates to the typical readme.md that you see on good git projects that tell people what your code does and how to get started using it)
- example Code for your demo

# Grading

- Make sure to email your class about anything that needs to be installed BEFORE coming (this is part of your grade so dont forget to CC me in your email!!! and put all the info into the forum!)
- EVEN if people do not NEED to install anything, email before in case others might decide to prepare for your presentations. So in other words, all e-Portfolios require an email.
- In class presentation of at lease 30min -- this includes a couple of slides and theory before moving quickly into the hands-on is good. Hands-on can also take longer and often this is not a problem when people want to learn this material. Keep in mind though that 30 mins is a pretty good time-span. People can come and ask you afterwards if they need more information.
- Relates to course needs
- Entry in forum correctly done
- Components: Sample code, in class demo, slides, tutorial written by you
- Some topics do not include code (RUP or Scrum) but they still need to include a demo using a tool that you choose to present
- e-Portfolio combines theory with practial application
- this is 20% of your grade so prepare accordingly
